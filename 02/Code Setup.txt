Day 2 — Setup & Coding Environment

Today we started with:
- 20 minutes of touch typing practice

Then we:
- Installed VS Code (or any code editor)
- Installed Google Chrome
- Installed some useful extensions like:
  - Prettier
  - Live Server
  - Any other helpful ones

Then we:
- Opened Chrome DevTools
- Clicked around
- Broke some websites
- Even played with the FBI Most Wanted site for fun 😭
  (You can literally change names and images and prank your friends)

The goal today:
- Get comfortable with the tools
- Understand the browser inspector
- Stop being afraid to click and experiment

Tomorrow:
We start writing real code.
