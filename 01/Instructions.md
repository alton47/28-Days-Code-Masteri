🚀 HTML Exercise: Project Setup Guide
This README provides quick instructions on how to take the HTML code provided and view it as a functional web page using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

📥 Step 1: Create the File
Open Visual Studio Code.

Go to File > New Text File (or press Ctrl+N / Cmd+N).

Save the file immediately as index.html.

Note: The .html extension is vital! It tells your computer this is a website, not just a text document.

📝 Step 2: Add the Code
Copy the HTML code provided in the previous response.

Paste it into your new index.html file in VS Code.

Save the changes (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S).

🌐 Step 3: Open in Browser
There are two ways to see your "Movie App" or "Chipsi Mayai" recipe:

Method A: The Simple Way (File Explorer)
Locate the file in your computer's folder.

Double-click it. It will open in your default browser (Chrome, Safari, or Edge).

Method B: The Pro Way (VS Code Extension)
In VS Code, click the Extensions icon on the left sidebar (or Ctrl+Shift+X).

Search for "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey.

Click Install.

Once installed, look at the bottom-right corner of VS Code and click "Go Live".

This will launch a local server and open your browser automatically. Any changes you save in the code will update the page instantly!

🛠 Exercise Challenges
Now that you have the file open, try these "Pro" tweaks:

Modify: Change one of the movie descriptions to your own review.

Add: Find a new movie poster URL and add an 11th movie to the table.

Link: Change the href in the footer to link to your personal Instagram or GitHub profile.
