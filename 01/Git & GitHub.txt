GIT & GITHUB CORE — The Only Things That Actually Matter

1. What is Git?
You don't need to know Programming to use Git & GitHub..
Git is a version control system. It tracks changes in your code so you can:
- Go back in time
- Experiment safely
- Not destroy your project
- Work with other people

2. What is GitHub?
GitHub is a plartform where you store your Git repositories online.

3. The Basic Workflow:

Code → Stage → Commit → Push → Merge

- You write code
- You stage it
- You commit it (save a snapshot)
- You push it to GitHub

4. The Most Important Commands / Actions:

- Clone → copy a repo to your computer
- Stage → choose what goes into the commit
- Commit → save a snapshot
- Push → send to GitHub
- Pull → get changes from GitHub

5. Branches:
Branches let you work without breaking the main project.

6. Merging:
Merging combines branches.

7. Merge Conflicts:
Happens when there's conflicting changes and Git doesn’t know which change to keep.
You manually fix it!!

8. Fork:
A copy of someone else’s repo into your own GitHub.

9. Pull Request (PR):
A request to merge your changes into another repo.

10. Golden Rules:
- Commit often
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Push regularly
- Never work directly on main for big changes

11. Pro Tip:
Use GitHub Desktop. It makes Git 10x easier.
