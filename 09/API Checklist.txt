APIs CORE — How Websites Talk to Each Other

1. An API is a messenger between systems.

2. APIs let you:
   - Get data
   - Send data
   - Update data
   - Delete data

3. The basics:
   - Request → you ask
   - Response → you receive
   - Data is usually JSON

4. Common actions:
   - GET → read data
   - POST → send data
   - PUT / PATCH → update data
   - DELETE → remove data

5. Endpoints:
   - A URL that does one job
   - Example:
     /users
     /posts/1

6. Status codes:
   - 200 → success
   - 400 → bad request
   - 401 → unauthorized
   - 404 → not found
   - 500 → server error

7. APIs are used for:
   - Weather apps
   - Payments
   - Auth (login)
   - Databases
   - AI services

8. APIs are NOT:
   - Frontend code
   - UI

9. If you understand:
   - Requests & responses
   - JSON
   - Endpoints
   You understand 80% of APIs.

Everything else is documentation and practice.
