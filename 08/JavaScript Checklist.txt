JAVASCRIPT CORE — The Only Things That Actually Matter

1. JavaScript makes the web interactive.

2. JavaScript can:
   - React to user actions
   - Change HTML & CSS
   - Fetch data
   - Control logic & flow

3. The most important concepts:
   - Variables → let, const
   - Functions → reusable logic
   - Conditions → if / else
   - Loops → for, while
   - Arrays & Objects → store data

4. Variables:
   - const → does NOT change
   - let → can change
   - Avoid var

5. Functions:
   - A function does ONE job
   - Reuse logic instead of repeating code

6. The DOM:
   - JavaScript talks to HTML through the DOM
   - You can select, change, add, remove elements

7. Events:
   - click, submit, input, hover
   - User actions trigger code

8. JavaScript is NOT:
   - A design tool
   - A styling language

9. If you understand:
   - Variables
   - Functions
   - Events
   - The DOM
   You understand 80% of JavaScript.

Everything else is patterns and practice.
