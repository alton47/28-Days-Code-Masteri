28 Days Code Mastery — Learn to Code by Building

This repo documents a 28-day journey where I’m teaching my brother how to code from absolute zero to building real-world websites, apps and 3D web experiences.

This is NOT about memorizing syntax.
This is about learning how to think, build, debug and ship real software.

There is a huge difference between:
- Learning a programming language
- Learning programming

This repo focuses on the second one.

Everything here is:
- 100% FREE
- Project-based
- Beginner-friendly
- Using modern 2026 best practices
- Using AI as a workflow tool, not a crutch
