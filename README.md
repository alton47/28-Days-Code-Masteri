# 🚀 28 Days Code Mastery — Learn to Code by Hand!

## 👋 Hi, I’m Allan

This repository documents a **28-day journey** where I’m teaching my brother how to code **from absolute zero** to building **real-world full-stack & 3D web projects**.

This is **NOT** about memorizing syntax.  
This is about **learning how to think, build, debug and ship real software**.

> There is a huge difference between:
> - ❌ Learning a programming language  
> - ✅ Learning **programming**

This repo focuses on the second one.

Everything here is:
- ✅ 100% FREE
- ✅ Project-based
- ✅ Beginner-friendly
- ✅ Using modern **2026 best practices**
- ✅ Using **AI as a workflow tool**, not a crutch
